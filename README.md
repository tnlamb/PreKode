# PreKode
Tnlamb: You can go ahead and create a new branch from the project and make your additions there. When you want to merge your branch with master just submit a pull request so others can review it first, to avoid conflicts.
So far I've added the initial xcode project, I've created a splash screen and menu page. Feel free to make revisions/additions within your own branch. If you have an idea for a UI improvement/addition and don't know how to make it then ask me and I'll try to do it with my mediocre photoshop skills.
